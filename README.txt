These are files for a project base laboratory course, which was run in the EECS department of the Colorado School of Mines in academic year 15/16. At CSM, the laboratory course is called the Systems Exploration, Engineering and Design (SEED) laboratory. 

An overview description of the SEED lab is given in the SEED Lab poster.pdf

Each folder contains the materials for the laboratory for a particular year. Each year the project changes, and the folder is named to reflect the project.
